Store listing assets checklist

Store listing (concise)

Screenshots
- Place screenshots in `assets/screenshots/`.
- Recommended filenames (keeps order):
	- `screenshot-01-options.jpg` (options page)
	- `screenshot-02-options.jpg` (alternate/options list)
	- `screenshot-03-popup.jpg` (popup/sidebar)
	- `screenshot-04-banner.jpg` (in-page banner)

Text & assets
- Short description (<=132 chars): "OpenWhen: open URLs on a schedule and show a short in-page reminder."
- Full description: summary and privacy note (schedules stored locally).
- Provide: screenshots, release notes (`RELEASE_NOTES.md`), privacy policy URL, support URL (https://github.com/dennymarcels/OpenWhen).

Notes
- Ensure screenshots do not show PII (blur URLs if needed).
- Prefer compressed JPEGs for store uploads (keep ~100â€“400 KB).
