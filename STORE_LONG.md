OpenWhen â€” Schedule URLs and get a quick reminder

OpenWhen lets you schedule URLs to open once or on a recurring cadence (daily, weekly, monthly). When a scheduled URL opens the extension displays a compact in-page banner that reminds you why you scheduled it. Schedules are stored locally in your browser (`chrome.storage.local`) and are not transmitted off your device.

Key features
- One-time or recurring schedules (daily / weekly / monthly)
- Open in foreground tab, background tab, or a new window
- Context-menu prefill from link or page for quick scheduling

Privacy
- All schedules are stored locally and not sent to external servers.

Support
- Report issues or request support via https://github.com/dennymarcels/OpenWhen
